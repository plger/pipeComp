Changes in version 0.99.3 (2020-02-07)
+ made important changes to the scRNAseq pipeline, greatly simplifying the format of the output. As a consequence, results produced with older version of the package are not anymore compatible with the current version's aggregation and plotting functions.

Changes in version 0.99.7 (2020-04-01)
+ Submitted to Bioconductor

Changes in version 0.99.23 (2020-04-21)
+ Added SVA-DEA pipeline and vignette
+ Standardized results heatmaps for any PipelineDefinition

Changes in version 0.99.27 (2020-04-29)
* the plotting functions for the scRNAseq clustering pipeline (`scrna_evalPlot_DR` and `scrna_evalPlot_clust`) have been replaced by more flexible, pipeline-generic functions (`evalHeatmap`) and a silhouette-specific plotting function (`scrna_evalPlot_silh`). The general heatmap coloring scheme has also been changed to make meaningful changes clearer.
